# Java ‚òïÔ∏è Examples üì±

A comprehensive collection of Java examples demonstrating various programming concepts from basic to advanced level. This repository is designed to help developers learn Java programming through practical examples.

## About Java

`Java` is a high-level, class-based, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA).

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+ (optional, for dependency management)
- Any text editor or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/halilozel1903/JavaExamples.git
cd JavaExamples

# Run all examples (interactive)
./run-examples.sh

# Or run individual examples
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="oop.ConstructorExample"
```

### Running Examples Manually
```bash
# Compile Java files
javac -d target/classes src/main/java/category/ExampleFile.java

# Run the compiled class
java -cp target/classes category.ExampleFile
```

### Using Maven
```bash
# Compile all examples
mvn compile

# Run a specific example
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="category.ExampleFile"

# Clean and rebuild
mvn clean compile
```

## Features Demonstrated üéØ

- **Modern Java Syntax** - Records, switch expressions, var keyword, text blocks
- **Best Practices** - Proper encapsulation, validation, error handling
- **Design Patterns** - Factory, Builder, Strategy patterns through examples
- **Functional Programming** - Lambdas, streams, functional interfaces
- **Collection Operations** - Modern collection manipulation with Stream API
